# Open-Labware

## About

This repository collects tutorials, slides, and code developed and maintained by the Open Labware Group, a special group that aim to build equipment using open source technologies. This group is based on the grouping made during BioRTC Summer School Training held at College of Medical Sciences, Yobe State University, Damaturu, Nigeria. Details abou the group. We were introduced into the world of Open Science and are empowered with the knowledge needed to create our own solutions for research needs inour local institutions. Details of the learning experience could also be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000014) and [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pyh2r/). We learned:- 

- How 3D printers work and how to design its parts 
- How to put together electronic circuits to create scientific equipment
- How to leverage open source knowledge to develop our own tools.

## Instructor

Andre Maia Chagas is an open science and open source hardware experts with a background in Neurosciences who have been developing affordable open science hardware and teaching others to do so via various workshops, talks and outreach events. He started [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com) and volunteer at [Trend in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org) as an open source adviser and by organizing and running Open Labware workshops.

Andre currently works at the [Department of Neurosciences](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/) in the University of Sussex, where he develop equipment to support research labs. For more details on those projects check the [Open Sussex Neuroscience page](https://sussex-neuroscience.github.io)

On my spare time I offer consultancy services around open science hardware through Prometheus Science. If you need to replicate a methods paper, or if youâ€™d like something custom built for your lab, get in touch!
