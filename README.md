# Open-Labware

Open-Labware materials
========================

This repository collects tutorials, slides, and code developed and maintained by the Open Labware Group.

Prior knowledge required: None, but previous experience with computers and repairing things is a plus. Without tools, there is no science. Reagents, computers, and especially research equipment are paramount to the collection of data that allows us to see nature in its finest details. During the workshop we will build selected equipment, using open source technologies. 

This will serve as an intro to the Open Science world and will empower participants with the knowledge needed to create their own solutions for research needs at their home institutions. More details on this approach can be seen here and here. Participants will leave the project with:

A general understanding of how 3D printers work and how to design parts for them.
How to put together electronic circuits to create scientific equipment
How to leverage open source knowledge to develop their own tools.
